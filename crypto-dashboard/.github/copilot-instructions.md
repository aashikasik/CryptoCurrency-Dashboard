This project is a Next.js crypto dashboard using TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, shadcn/ui, and a charting library. It fetches data from the CoinGecko API and includes features like paginated coin list, search/filter, coin details with charts, and a localStorage-based watchlist. Please generate clean, reusable components, handle loading/error/empty states, and ensure responsive design for Vercel deployment.
